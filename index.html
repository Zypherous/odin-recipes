    <h2>Where do my recipes come from?</h2>
    <p>Often times I am asked: "From where did you get your recipes?". Casually I'll reply with a joke 
    <br>
    <strong>"Batman taught me that particular one."</strong>
    <br>
    <strong>"Picked it up on a trip to <em>Atlantis</em>..."</strong>
    <br>
    The actual truth is much more spectacular, I learned all these recipes from my nephew, aged 5.
