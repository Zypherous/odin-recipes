    <h1>Chemical Concoction</h1>
    <p>Picture this, you're walking the streets of NYC at 11 PM, passing by that little italian restaunt at the corner of your block when suddenly your nostrils get a big wiff of some sweet flowery yet pungent aroma. You move your head around, seeking the source and discover its the man in a dirty white apron tossing a bucket full of some chemical concoction. Your mouth waters but you know you have no clue of what was in that bucket. My nephew has perfected this tasty soup and or beverage.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1/4 cup H2O</li>
        <li> 2/3 cup purple Fabuloso</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup clorox</li>
        <li> vinegar to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>The first step and final step is to pour all the ingredients into a large cup.</li>
        <li>Enjoy! Bonus flavor if you clean some dirty floors with a mini mop using the ingredients then wring it back into the cup.</li>
    </ol>
